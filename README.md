# Ven3 assessment

A new Flutter project.

Step 1: Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

For Windows:

Windows OS (Windows 10 or higher is recommended)
Git: Download and install Git for Windows from https://gitforwindows.org/
Flutter: Follow the installation instructions for Windows from the official Flutter website (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows)
Visual Studio Code (optional but recommended): Download and install VSCode from https://code.visualstudio.com/


For macOS:

macOS (macOS 10.12 or higher is recommended)
Xcode: Install Xcode from the Mac App Store (required for iOS development)
Git: Git should already be installed on macOS. You can check by running git --version in the terminal.
Flutter: Follow the installation instructions for macOS from the official Flutter website (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos)
Visual Studio Code (optional but recommended): Download and install VSCode from https://code.visualstudio.com/

Step 2: Clone the GitHub Repository

Open your command line terminal (Windows Command Prompt or macOS Terminal) and navigate to the directory where you want to store your Flutter project. Then, run the following command to clone the GitHub repository: https://github.com/thenaijadev/ven3

Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory

Use the cd command to navigate into the project directory: cd ven3

Step 4: Install Dependencies

Flutter projects typically have dependencies that need to be installed. Use the following command to fetch and install the project dependencies: flutter pub get

Step 5: Run the Flutter Project

Now you can run the Flutter project using the flutter run command. Ensure that you are in the project directory when running this command.

For Android: flutter run
For iOS (macOS only, and Xcode must be installed): flutter run

Flutter will build and run the app on your connected Android or iOS device or emulator.

Please ensure you have a mobile device connected to your computer. Alternatively , you can set up an Android emulator or an IOS simulator on you local machine. Note that you can only run a Flutter application on IOS using a computer running macOS.

Please also note that all commands are to be entered using terminal. VsCode has an integrated terminal but you can also use any other terminal of your choice but be mindful of the directory you are in.
